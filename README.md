- Many operations in JavaScript are asynchronous
- Callbacks are the basic tool for working with asynchronous operations
- Callbacks have disadvantages related to complexity, loss of control, and error handling

- Promises wrap around callbacks and make them easer to work with
- Promises are syntactically messy
